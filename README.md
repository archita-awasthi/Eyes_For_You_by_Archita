Project's goal was to develop a mobile application that aimed to unravel and simplify the day to day complications faced
by a visually impaired individual and as well as assist an aware individual.
The original idea came from Cortana, Siri and other Artificial Intelligence.

The only way a visually impaired person can communicate is via VOICE,
keeping that in mind we implemented an intelligent voice recognition assistant for android where functionality for an individual’s
day to day chores are simplified.
